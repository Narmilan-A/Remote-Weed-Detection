## Brief explanation of unet_training.py
| Main steps                           | Brief Explanation                                                                                                                  |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Import Libraries                     | Import Python libraries: NumPy, OS, Pandas, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-image for image processing, GDAL for geospatial data handling, scikit-learn and Keras for model development. |
| Calculate Vegetation Indices         | Define `calculate_veg_indices` function to compute various vegetation indices from multispectral images.                          |
| Tile Images and Masks and define paths | Split images and masks into tiles with specified size and overlap, and specify root directories for images and masks. Retrieve files and preprocess tiles. |
| Convert Masks to Categorical         | Convert mask data to categorical representation using one-hot encoding.                                                             |
| Train-Test Split                     | Split data into training and testing sets using scikit-learnâ€™s `train_test_split` function.                                        |
| U-Net Architecture                   | Define U-Net model architecture with convolutional and deconvolutional layers for semantic segmentation.                           |
| Model Compilation                    | Compile U-Net model with Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.                                                         |
| Model Training                       | Train model on training data and validate it using testing data. Save best model checkpoint based on validation loss.               |
| Confusion Matrix and Classification Report | Predict on test data, calculate confusion matrix and classification report. Plot confusion matrix as heatmap.                 |
| IoU Calculation                      | Calculate and save Intersection over Union (IoU) for each class in segmentation.                                                    |
