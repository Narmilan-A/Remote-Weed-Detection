# Remote-Weed-detection
Weed control is a costly and time-consuming issue for land managers across Australia. The detection of weed populations is always the first step towards achieving efficacious control. We are committed to investigating the possibilities and the limitations of remote sensing technologies for the detection of weeds in mixed landscapes.
