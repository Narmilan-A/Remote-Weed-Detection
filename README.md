## Weed managers guide to Remote Detection
Weed control is a costly and time-consuming issue for land managers across Australia. The detection of weed populations is always the first step towards achieving efficacious control. We are committed to investigating the possibilities and the limitations of remote   sensing technologies for the detection of weeds in mixed landscapes. 

The challenge: Remote sensing technology is currently used across various agricultural and environmental contexts but challenges remain. The expense and technical complexity of the technology often limits uptake by land managers, while complex natural systems make it difficult to distinguish weeds from other vegetation, especially during early stages of weed growth. There is a need for those engaging in weed remote detection to access educational information and connect with others also working in this space to share learnings, resources and expertise. 

Our response: Our aim is to help land managers to effectively understand and use available and emerging remote sensing technologies for weed detection and provide a facility for them to access resources and connect with others in this field, thereby facilitating increased uptake and use of the technology to detect and manage weeds in various landscapes. We are working with weed management experts from across agricultural and environmental fields to test the limits of current remote sensing technology for detecting weeds in diverse ecosystems, thereby improving mapping and monitoring of weed populations and achieving more effective on-ground weed management.</div>
